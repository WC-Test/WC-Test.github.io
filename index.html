			<p><font color="white">In high context communication, communication is taken in context, people in a country with high context communication people are, in general are more trusting, because they don't have to be really specific, and people will understand what they are saying. In a low context communication culture, people have to be really specific, and are generally less trusting. For example, in a high context culture, sarcasm is funny, because they know that it is sarcastic. In a low context culture, sarcasm is either not understood or not appreciated.</font></p>

		<center><font face="verdana" color="orange">Large Comfort with Conflict vs Small Comfort with Conflict (Also Uncertainty Avoidance)</font></center>
			<p><font color="white">In a place with a larger comfort of conflict, people are more relaxed about other's opinions, whereas in a culture with small comfort of conflict, they are not relaxed about other's opinions. For example, in a place with large comfort, if two friends disagreed on something, they would just get over it, and live with each others differences. In a place with small confort, if two friends disagreed on something, they had to work something out right then and there or they couln't be friends anymore. Uncertainty avoidance is the amount of tolerable uncertainty in a given situation. If you were talking to a girl, then in some cultures, if you were unsure if she liked you, in some cultures, you need to just figure it out eventually, while in other cultures you need to figure it out immediately.</font></p>

		<center><font face="verdana" color="yellow"> Collectivistic vs Individualistic</font></center>
			<p><font color="white">In a collectivistic culture, people look out for the group interest more than thei rown interests, as the "collective" in the name suggests. Conversly, in an individualistic culture, people look out for their own interests more than the group. This doesn't make them bad people, it just doesn't mean that they look out for the entire group as much as themselves. Japanese kamikaze fighters happily sacrificed themselves for the greater good of their country. In America, capitalism means that people try to work their way up and make a lot of money, they aren't trying to make America money as much as they are trying to make themselves money.</font></p>

		<center><font face="green" color="green">Internal Locus of Control vs External Locust of Control</font></center>
			<p><font color="white">Internal vs External Locus of control shows what the reason for something happening is attributed to. For an internal locus of control, one might do well on a test and then say that they were smart. It is being controlled by themselves, like them being smart. For the external locus of control, if you did well on a test, you would say that the test was easy. The reason that they did well would be attributed to the test being easy.</font></p>

			<p><font color="white">High vs Low power distance is the distance between social classes in a society. In a high power distance society, those who are high class hve much much more power than those in lower classes. An example would be the high class being nobles and the next lowest class being underpaid workers. In a low power distance society, the classes wouldd be very close together, like in America.</font></p>

		<center><font face="verdana" color="indigo">Horizontal Transmission vs Vertical Transmission</font></center>
			<p><font color="white">Horizontal transmission is information and standards transmitted through peers, and people of similar age. Vertical transmission is information or standards transmitted from parent to child, or people from different generations. For example, manners would be vertical transmission because they would be taught by parents, while things like memes are horizontal transmission because they are made by people of the same generation     </font></p>
