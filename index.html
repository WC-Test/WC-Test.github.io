<center> High Context vs Low Context Communication </center>
<p> In high context communication, communication is taken in context, people in a country with high context communication people are, in general are more trusting, because they don't have to be really specific, and people will understand what they are saying. In a low context communication culture, people have to be really specific, and are generally less trusting. For example, in a high context culture, sarcasm is funny, because they know that it is sarcastic. In a low context culture, sarcasm is either not understood or not appreciated. </p>
<center> Large Comfort with Conflict vs Small Comfort with Conflict (Also Uncertainty Avoidance) </center>
<p> In a place with a larger comfort of conflict, people are more relaxed about other's opinions, whereas in a culture with small comfort of conflict, they are not relaxed about other's opinions. For example, in a place with large comfort, if two friends disagreed on something, they would just get over it, and live with each others differences. In a place with small confort, if two friends disagreed on something, they had to work something out right then and there or they couln't be friends anymore. Uncertainty avoidance is the amount of tolerable uncertainty in a given situation. If you were talking to a girl, then in some cultures, if you were unsure if she liked you, in some cultures, you need to just figure it out eventually, while in other cultures you need to figure it out immediately. </p>
